# CokerListMaker
Coker's List Maker is a simple utility to create directory and file listings on a Windows PC. This program creates a complete listing (TXT or CSV) of any directory's content the user chooses. If you find this program helpful, please consider a donation. This simple program is a free, non-profit tool. 

Running the Program for the First Time:
Because this is a free utility from an independent developer, you may see a "Windows protected your PC" warning message upon first launch. This is standard for applications that can't afford to pay annual code-signing fees. Just click the More info link, and you will see a button that allows you to Run anyway.
